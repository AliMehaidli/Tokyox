								<a href="images/miyamotomusashi.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/miyamotomusashi.jpg" alt="miyamotomusashi" title="miyamotomusashi"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: gameslover2106<br>Manga: Vagabond</h3>
								<p>Although this panel also was a winner within <a href="index.html">this month's overall panel submission winners page</a>. It still deserves a place within the beauty page, because
                                    of how beautifully drawn it is. This panel encapsulates Takehiko Inoue penmanship, and how he has claimed himself as one of the best mangaka of all time. 
                                </p>

								<a href="images/yoshikagekira.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/yoshikagekira.jpg" alt="Yoshikagekira"  title="Yoshikagekira"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: Firebreather0231<br>Manga: JoJo's Bizzare Adventure</h3>
								<p>Yoshikage Kira is the villian within part four of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. He is beautifully drawn to upmost detail, and most definitely deserves a place within Tokyox's beauty page.

                                </p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/kaneki.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/kaneki.jpg" alt="kaneki" title="kaneki"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: lolol2131<br> Manga: Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
								<p>Ken Kaneki was a human who was turned into a ghoul. This manga panel represents his mind leaving disarray and further into nothingness.
                                     The blank background depicts his mindset, as he looks up in a moment of silence.
                                     This time stopping scene is familar to most manga readers and this is generally what people remember when they think of toyko ghoul.
                                </p>

								<a href="images/jjk.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/jjk.jpg" alt="jjk" title="jjk"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: cyclerider211<br>Manga: Jujutsu Kaisen
                                </h3>
								<p>Gojo flies through the sky displaying his power over his enemy. The sky in the background is beautiful, and his egotistical expression sums his character up really well. </p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/punpun.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/punpun.jpg" alt="punpun" title="punpun"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: joedie05<br>Manga: Oyasumi Pun Pun</h3>
								<p>
                                    This panel was also selected to be on the main page of Toykox, and was overall one of the best this month, but it's beauty is what really got it there. The scenery is impeccable. The starlit sky and the children looking up at it is drawn perfectly and only pleases the eyes to look at.
                                    
                                </p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/freedom.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/freedom.jpg" alt="aot" title="aot"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: catlover2012<br>Manga: Attack on Titan</h3>
								<p>This one was a winner from the overall list, but it is also extremely beautiful. Eren soaring through the skies, with his character drawn with an enthralled expression, really seals the deal, and gets it onto this list.</p>
