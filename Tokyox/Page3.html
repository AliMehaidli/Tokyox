                    </header>
                    <p> This is the Tokyox otherpage! This is where the top six highest scored manga panels in the "other" category land in. The other category is generally something unique to the submitter,
                        and has to do with how the panels effect people individually. Other rating scale higher than beauty, and meaning, so if other rating are lower than beauty, and meaning, they can still overpower
                        them.
