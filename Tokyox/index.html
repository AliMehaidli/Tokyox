                </header>
                <p>Tokyox establishes itself as a community of individuals who enjoy reading manga and contain appreciation towards 
                    specific manga panels. We hope to have formed a place for manga enjoyers to come together, and appreciate their 
                    favorite pieces of panels within the manga they enjoy. This community is NOT intended for a certain area or type of 
                    person, but just an international community or people to appreciate manga. Submissions of your favorite manga panels 
                    are available, through submission and are also available through the contact form. This website changes monthly in manga 
                    panels through submissions, and brief analysis of the manga panels will also be displayed. The manga panels are rated through a vote with three different rating. One is it's beauty,
                    two it's meaning, and three a unique reason it is as powerful as it is. The top six panels that have the highest rating of the three averaged together display on the main page, and the one's that scale highest in other rating will have their own pages.
                    There is a page for beauty, meaning, and unique reasoning on this page, and a place for all panels!

                        <h3>Submitter: gameslover2106<br>Manga: Vagabond</h3>
                        <p>Miyamoto Musashi reached his personal peak point of philosophy. His swords spin the wave, and everything is beautifully 
                            detailed. This quote from Vagabond encapsulates this panel. "A precipitous slope, a narrow river width, a fast and violent flow.
                             Due to the terrain and the external influence, the state of the water is perfectly decided. And yet, water obeys only itself. 
                             Water is only water. Thoroughly water. Absolutely free."

                        <h3>Submitter: RobloxFan51<br>Manga: Vinland Saga</h3>
                        <p>Thorfinn Karlseni is beaten to a pulp, as he refuses to fight embraces the way of the pacifist. He no longer wants to kill, repeating the cycle of violence is pointless.
                            He remembers a quote from his father, "A true warrior doesn't need a sword."

                        <h3>Submitter: FriendlyToad031<br> Manga: Berserk</h3>
                        <p>Guts smiles while on the verge of death since his friends are still alive. Though he sacrified his body, and is a walking sacrifice, he learned frienship, and that
                            those friends he made on his journey are more important that anything, even his own well being.

                        </h3>
                        <p>Johan Liebert the evil antagonist of Monster, lets out his most powerful message throughout the whole story. As a survivior of a cruel experiment to develop a new dictator post World War 2, he himself
                            became a monster. Denying humanity, and seeeing the flaws within it, he came to the conclusion that humans are only at equal ground, at their last breath. </p>

                        <h3>Submitter: joedie05<br>Manga: Oyasumi Pun Pun</h3>
                        <p>This beautiful scenary encapsulates the dreams that a childhood can envail. This was the final panel before the time skip to Pun Pun's teenage years, and works as a gateway between his childish
                            and his past.

                            his character. He has finally achieved his freedom from persecution, even though everyone must die for him to gain it.</p>
