								<a href="images/makima.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/makima.jpg" alt="makima" title="makima"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: mrincredible<br>Manga: Chainsaw man</h3>
								<p>Makima the villian of this story is a devil and already has that connotation to her being evil, but this manga really displays her evil at full lengths. She uses her devil
                                    abilities to trade souls of people, and this really displays her power gap between her and the enemies she is facing. This panel has a strong meanign, and foreshadowing of just how powerful she is.
                                </p>

								<a href="images/vinlandsaga.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/vinlandsaga.jpg" alt="vinlandsaga"  title="vinlandsaga"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: RobloxFan51<br>Manga: Vinland Saga</h3>
								<p>This panel just made it on the overall list for the month, but it struck a powerful meaning to the voters. There is a clear reason that this occured. Thorfinn followed a path of revenge and violence after his father's death.
                                    After losing his chance of revenge for his father's death, Thorfinn had nothing left. He had to come to the realization that killing and violence is pointless, and only breeds more, and this panel encapsulates that perfectly."

								<a href="images/guts.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/guts.png" alt="guts" title="guts"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: FriendlyToad031<br> Manga: Berserk</h3>
								<p>This one was a winner on the overall manga page, but it does an amazing job encapsulating guts as a character. The work that his put in to get to this position was tragic. He lost
                                    friends along the way, but also gained some too. He faced death countless times, and was betrayed by the world. The smile on his injured face, displays that he has changed to accept lost
                                    and that he still has friends he must protect.

								<h3>Submitter: onepiece2<br>Manga: Onepiece
                                </h3>
								<p>Ace is the son of a world's most renowned criminal. He felt hated by everyone, and felt he didn't have a place in humanity. Luffy loved him, and Ace expressed his thanks for Luffy loving as he was dying. This scene
                                    is one of the most impactful scenes in all of manga. </p>

								<a href="images/youngthorfin.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/youngthorfin.jpg" alt="youngthorfin" title="youngthorfin"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: waterbender2<br>Manga: Vinland Saga</h3>
								<p>This manga panel shows Thorfinn when he was young, bound to revenge, and denied the peace of pacifism. Kill or be killed is how he lived, and this panel encapsulates that ideology, and what Thorfinn used to be.
                                </p>

								<a href="images/musashicry.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/musashicry.jpg" alt="musashicry" title="musashicry"/></a>
								<h3>Submitter: takezo21<br>Manga: Vagabond</h3>
								<p>Miyamoto Musashi crying is one of the most iconic manga panels of all time. The meaning behind this scene has undeniable depth. Miyamoto cries at life, and what he missed throughout
                                     his life of rage, and violence. He missed the things around him, and the little things in life that tie to everyone and everything around him.
